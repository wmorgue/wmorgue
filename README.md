iOS Developer with a background in DevOps.

I am seeking a new full-time, fully remote iOS developer position.
My primary expertise is in `SwiftUI`, but I also have over four years of experience in a variety of other languages and technologies, including `DevOps`.

My open source app:

1. [Onflow status](https://github.com/wmorgue/OnflowStatus)
2. [DubDubMap](https://github.com/wmorgue/DubDubMap)


- [x] I am the owner and operator of a [vrm0rgu3 telegram channel](https://t.me/vrm0rgu3) focused on  SwiftUI development.
- [x] You can reach me: [Telegram](https://t.me/maybequantum), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-rossik-479120238/), [Email](maybequantumbit@icloud.com).
