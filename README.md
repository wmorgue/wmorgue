iOS Developer with a background in DevOps.

I am seeking a new full-time, fully remote iOS developer position.
My primary expertise is in `SwiftUI`, but I also have over four years of experience in a variety of other languages and technologies, including `DevOps`.

My app's:

1. [Imagine Diffusion](https://apple.co/3MheCs5) `macOS`
2. [MockerPie](https://apple.co/3KVRXSU) `iPadOS`
3. [Onflow status](https://github.com/wmorgue/OnflowStatus) `iOS`
4. [DubDubMap](https://github.com/wmorgue/DubDubMap) `iOS`

Notes (mostly in russian):
 - A [quick note about](https://t.me/vrm0rgu3/168?comment=238) `Structured Concurrency`.
 - Note about [@ marker protocol Sendable { }](https://t.me/vrm0rgu3/169)
 - [Swift 5.8 release note](https://gist.github.com/wmorgue/f095c4577e3f21ada735b1962328cfc6)
