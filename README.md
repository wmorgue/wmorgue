iOS Developer with a background in DevOps.

I am seeking a new full-time, fully remote iOS developer position.
My primary expertise is in `SwiftUI`, but I also have over four years of experience in a variety of other languages and technologies, including `DevOps`.

My app:

2. [DubDubMap](https://github.com/wmorgue/DubDubMap)
3. [MockerPie](https://apple.co/3KVRXSU)
