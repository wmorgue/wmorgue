iOS Developer with a background in DevOps.

I'm looking for a new full-time, full-remote iOS developer position.
I am primarily a `SwiftUI` person, but with 4+ years of other knowledge & languages including `DevOps`.

My open source app:

1. [Onflow status](https://github.com/wmorgue/OnflowStatus)


- [x] I'm running the [vrm0rgu3 telegram channel](https://t.me/vrm0rgu3) about  SwiftUI development.
- [x] You can reach me: [Telegram](https://t.me/maybequantum), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikita-rossik-479120238/), [Email](maybequantumbit@icloud.com).
